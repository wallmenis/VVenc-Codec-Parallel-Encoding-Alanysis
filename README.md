This is an assignment for the Video Coding class in our university (University of Thessally)

We are tasked on evaluating vvenc's performance based on a different number of threads and a 
few settings (mainly whether we use 2x2 row x column tiles and whether WaveFront synchronization
is on or off).

Feel free to contribute anything after the deadline has passed (1st of March 2024)

This is a joint effort by Dimosthenis Krallis (wallmenis) and David Parathyras (h1dd3n3y3).
